1. Write a program that prints a restaurant bill including tax and tip.  Read from the console the price of each item the customer ordered (keep reading prices until the user enters 0 or something like that).  Then print out the prices in a column, followed by the tax (8.875% of the total), the tip (15% of the total rounded up to the nearest dollar), and the grand total.  Try to make the output look nice, with the numbers lined up.

1. Here's the signature of a method that takes an array of integers and returns true if any number in the array appears more than once.
   ```java
   static bool containsDuplicate(int[] numbers);
   ```
   Write the method.

1. Write a method that takes an array of names (strings) and splits them into two arrays, of first names and last names.  For example, if you call the method with the array `["Alex Samuel", "Mel Yıldırım"]`, it produces the arrays `["Alex", "Mel"]` and `["Samuel", "Yıldırım"]`.
